# Javadoc 9 Taglet Example

I was looking for examples of how to create Taglets using the new Javadoc API in Java 9+,
but struggled to find anything.
So I've put together this example showing how to achieve write some simple Taglets.

I've worked out how to write these Taglets primarily through trial and error,
so make no guarantees that they are the best way to do things,
and I'm happy to take corrections and improvements!

The `taglet` project has code for creating some simple Taglets,
and the `example` project is an example of using these Taglets.
